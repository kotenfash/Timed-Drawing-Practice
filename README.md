# Timed-Drawing-Practice
simple thing to load photos, set up a timer and draw


Set timer = time the image will be shown until the next one.
Set rest = time before it change to the next one (extra time for loads and any other reason)
Start = starts the timer.
Pause = pauses the timer.
Reset = Reset the timer setting, not the images.
Load = Load imagees you want to be added to the queue (!ADD EVERY IMAGE YOU WANT IN A SINGLE SELECTION! If you load any image then click load again the first selection will be lost.)
Previous = Goes back to the previous image
Next = Go to the next image.


--Config--
Background color: Change background color
Text color: Change the text color
Button color: Change the buttons colors
Timer Sound: Set a sound for the timer
Rest Sound: Set a sound for the rest timer
Toggle theme: Toggle betwen white and black theme.

---HOW TO USE---
1. Open
2. Type numbers (in seconds) for the timer and the rest timer, rest timer can be 0 if you dont want a rest time (both are measured in seconds, so if you want 10 minutes per image you need this to be 600 seconds)
3. Click "Set Timer"
4. Click "Load"
5. Select all images you want for that session (NOTE: If you Load a set of images and then load another set of images the first set will be overwrited, so select everything in one go!)
6. Click "Start"
   That's it!

   IF YOU ARE USING VERY LARGE IMAGES, IT MAY TAKE A FEW SECONDS FOR THE IMAGES TO BE RESIZED TO FIT THE WINDOW SIZE. KEEP THIS IN MIND.
   Lastly, im not a professional dev i just made this because i needed.
